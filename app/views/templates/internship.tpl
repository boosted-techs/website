                            <li class="disable">Financial technology is not completely new. The industry has been around for enough time to witness its ups and downs. Everyone can see how technology is changing finance. But still, there are a lot of gaps in information. Still, there are hundreds of people who ask Why Fintech? Even today. There seem to be thousands of blogs and posts on the internet, but they confuse people even more. Too much information is often like no information.</li>
                            <li class="disable">
                                In such a case, if you belong to the interested but confused group of people, then your only savior is FinTech courses. Financial technology has only one way to go, and that is up, as believed by the experts. The industry will grow even more strong, and it will be advantageous to have certification for FinTech courses on your side.
